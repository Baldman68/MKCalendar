# MKCalendar
A basic, yet hard to find for some reason, SwiftUI based Calendar View

You can add an array of Dates to show events (as indicated with a dot) on a specific date.  You can change dates by tapping on the month year in the upper left and then using the chooser pictured below.  Also you can use the left and right arrows to change months.

Quickly choose a different month and or year to display.
